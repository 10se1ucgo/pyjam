Download the latest version from the [`Releases`](https://github.com/10se1ucgo/pyjam/releases) tab\r\n2. Launch `pyjam` and go to `File>Settings`\r\n   1. Browse for your Steam path into the `Path to Steam` option. \r\n      - The program will try to guess where Steam is beforehand and may be filled out\r\n   2. Enter the name into the `Profile/game name` option. \r\n      - It's simply used as a profile name and the name does not matter.\r\n   3. Browse for the folder of the game into the `Game path` option. \r\n      - ***BE SURE TO INCLUDE THE MOD FOLDER IN THERE AS WELL***, e.g., `/Steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf2/`\r\n   4. Browse for the path of the audio folder you want for this game into the `Audio path` option.\r\n   5. Enter the audio rate of that game into the `Audio rate` option.\r\n      - Normally, this is 11025.\r\n      - However, CS:GO uses the CELT audio codec, so use 22050 if creating a CS:GO profile. (Higher quality!)\r\n   6. Select a key for the `Relay key` option.\r\n      - For quick selection, click on the drop down arrow and press a key on your keyboard to select a key\r\n      - The default option usually works just fine (unless you have a bind that uses `=`)\r\n   7. Select a key for the `Play key` option.\r\n      - For quick selection, click on the drop down arrow and press a key on your keyboard to select a key\r\n   8. Select whether or not you want to use aliases.\r\n      - Aliases allow for you to select songs in console using words instead of an index number\r\n      - Disable if you think there might be conflicts.\r\n   9. Press `Save game`, and then exit the dialog.\r\n   9. Congratulations! Your first game has been set up.\r\n3. Put in your audio!\r\n   1. If you already have audio converted and ready to go, drop them into the audio folder you designated for the game\r\n   2. Otherwise, if you have audio downloaded, but not converted, use the `Audio converter` to convert them to the proper format\r\n   3. If you don't have an audio at all, use the `Audio downloader` and download from your favorite streaming sites!\r\n   4. Lastly, hit the `Refresh tracks` button in order to make sure that pyjam has detected all of your songs.\r\n4. Ready? Press `Start`, and load up your game.\r\n   - If pyjam is not immediately loaded when you start the game, type `exec jam.cfg` in console to fix that.\r\n5. Have fun!\r\n\r\n# THANKS\r\nThanks to Dx724 for the wonderful icon.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
